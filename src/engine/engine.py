# each tick, game takes vector of actions and a state and returns a vector of resources and a state
# each action requiresâ†² a cost in resources, and a cost in tick. an agent is frozen during tick cost
# an agent is defined by a memory space that contains both instructions and data. It executes instructions incrementally following a pointer. There may be jump instructions. instructions are sent as a (possibly useless) action to the game, or modify the internal state of the agent.
# if an agent pointer reaches an illegal position, the agent dies
