This project aims at being a playground for quirky exploration.
It essentially involves making loosely RNA-inspired self-modifying sequences of instructions and data play various games in a generic fashion.
There is no final purpose to this project except being a continuous source of interesting problems.
Any improvement, be it better sequence generations, faster software execution, new experiments, better benchmarking, additional games or expanded instruction sets, anything really, is welcome.

At first, I intend on mostly only collaborating with some of my real life friends, but feel free to send pull requests or inquiries if it interests you.
Licensing is still to be determined though, but you can already assume that this code is free for educational purposes and for open source projects.

## How to run the code
Given a recent Python3 install and a Bash interpreter, just execute the `launch.sh` file for a demo!
If you prefer, you may also use the Dockerfile by executing the `docker_launch.sh` file.
